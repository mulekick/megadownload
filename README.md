# Megadownload

*Browse the internet for content you like and save it to your local hard drive in minutes. Save bandwidth at the expense of diskspace. Free yourself of ads.*

#### See that [youtube/twitch/dailymotion/whatever](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mulekick/megadownload/master/platformslist) video that you keep going back to every day for weeks on end because you enjoy it so much ? Why not saving it locally so you're one click away from playing it whenever you like without being bothered by ads ? Why not reduce bandwidth consumption and server load, thus saving energy ? Provided hereby are the means to achieve this easily. Give it a try ! ####

## Prerequisites
   - Linux distro or WLS2 (debian 10.4.0 recommended)
   - GNU Bash shell (version 5.0.3 recommended)
   - node.js (version 14.17.4 recommended)
   - FFmpeg (version  4.1.6-1~deb10u1 recommended)
   - npm (version 7.20.3 recommended)
   - git (version 2.20.1 recommended)

## How to install

### Install FFmpeg first :
   - [FFmpeg provides officially supported packages for Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora and Red Hat](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)
   - To install them, type : `sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg`
   - Afterwards, ensure installation succeded by typing : `ffmpeg -version`

### Install the program :
   - Navigate to your install directory and type :
   - `git clone https://github.com/mulekick/megadownload.git`
   - `cd megadownload`
   - `npm install`

## How to use

### Save your HTTP session to a file
   - Open your web browser and launch developer tools (F12 on Chrome/Edge).
   - Start recording your HTTP session (on Chrome/Edge : 'Network' tab, then Ctrl+E to start/stop recording).
   - Go to [your favorite platforms](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mulekick/megadownload/master/platformslist), watch videos, listen to music ...
   - Once you're done, save your HTTP session to a .har file (on Chrome/Edge : 'Network' tab, 'All', right click any item then 'Save all as HAR with content').

### Execute the program
   - Open your shell, navigate to your install directory and type :
```bash
./megadownload.js -i /path/to/your/http/session/file -o /path/to/your/download/directory
```

### Download the files
   - Review the duration/quality of the media probed from your HTTP session file and confirm.
   - Wait for your files to download.
   - Enjoy ad free, network latency free content !

*One major limitation of this program is that **_downloaded files are given random names_**. Once downloads are completed, navigate your history to see which media you've viewed, then copy/paste media titles to the downloaded files. Use durations to match downloaded files with viewed media.*

## Some advice

### Using options
   - You can provide multiple http session files after the **-i** option. All will be processed.
   - Type `./megadownload.js -h` to see all available options.
   - The default minimal media duration is 90 seconds, which means that all media lasting less than 90 seconds will be discarded. You can adjust it with the **-d** option.
   - If you want to download audio-only files, use the **-a** option.
   - As a bonus, a small script is included that will convert any media to an *.mp3 file. Download music from the platforms and make your own local playlists !
   - To run it, type `. mp3convert.sh /path/to/files/to/convert` (the mp3 files will be saved in the same directory as the source files).

### Things you need to know
   - All the successfully probed media from your HTTP session will be downloaded *in the highest possible resolution/audio quality*. That sometimes means lenghty downloads, but the result is enjoyable üòÅ.
   - Don't panic if you end up with exotic file formats like *.webm, *.opus, *.adts, etc... (web media players use such formats, so your locally installed player should be able to play them as well).
   - I routinely use it to download like 40-50 videos at the same time. Don't hesitate to feed it large 150-200 Mb .har files !
   - At the same time, don't go too much above the 50 simultaneous downloads mark or the progress bars may behave unexpectedly and mess up your terminal. Experiment until you find the volume of HAR data you're comfortable using.
   - You can also use HTTP capture software like [Fiddler](https://www.telerik.com/fiddler) or [httpry](https://linux.die.net/man/1/httpry) to generate your .har files.

*Remember that the server urls providing access to media often expire after a few hours. In other words, don't wait too long before feeding your HTTP session files to the program.*

### Standard mode
   - When using standard mode (default), the algorithm will uniquely identify the media to download **by their duration in seconds only**.
   - It's the default mode you want to use for lengthy videos like movies or series (which rarely have the exact same duration) or just want to scrap the platforms for random content you may want to keep.
   - The downside to this is that if your session contains multiple media with the same duration, the following situations may occur :
     - Some media are missing
     - Media undesirably contain only audio or video. 
     - Video from a media is muxed with the audio of another media.
     - Some high resolution videos are of a lesser quality compared to their platform-hosted counterparts (due to the source video stream having a lower bitrate).
   - Despite this, standard mode should be sufficient in 90% of the cases.

### Extensive mode
   - When using extensive mode (**-e**), the algorithm will seek to extract **as much media as possible from your session**, so you'll often end up with :
     - duplicate media, be they of the same or different resolution/quality.
     - audio-only or video-only irrelevant files.
   - It's the mode you want to use when standard mode fails to do the job, for example :
     - You want to download multiple videos of the same duration.
     - You want to farm top quality videos with the highest bitrate thus have to be sure that you download the largest files.
   - The downside to this is that you'll often download a lot of garbage in the process that you'll have to manually delete afterwards.

## Notes
- Dear Github user, [star FFmpeg](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg) !
- [The HTTP Archive format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAR_(file_format))
- My approach was to minimize transcoding operations in order to keep the system resources footprint as light as possible, thus the "exotic" file formats.
- This project is of course named after the late [megaupload.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megaupload). Shout out to everyone who was there to witness this glorious slice of internet history !
